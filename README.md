# Personal Website
## Description
  This website is the portfolio that I will be developing over the course of the semester. It will be used to showcase my work and projects. It will be continuously updated and refactored as time goes on. The only data here so far is the first module, but it will be fleshed out as time goes on. The first draft is written in HTML5 and CSS, but Javascript will be added in the future. 

## Installation
